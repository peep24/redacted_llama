# redacted_llama

This is a hello world Laravel Application i was messing around with to explore the Sanctum Token system and Laravels API setup. 
I was using this to make test transactions on a test Eth network i was running locally using Ganache-cli.
When running you can send requests through Postman to the app and register, authenticate, getbalance, credit Eth from a main bank account. etc. 
Very basic, i was just messing around.
You can find a really usefull command for setting up the Ganache-cli test server in the accounts.txt file.
